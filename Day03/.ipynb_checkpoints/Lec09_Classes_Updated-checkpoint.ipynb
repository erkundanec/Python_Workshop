    "## Introduction\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm which provides a means of **structuring programs** so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, an object could represent an Employee with a name, employeeID, designation, salary, age, address, etc., with behaviors like project, projectID, shift, etc. Or an email with properties like recipient list, subject, body, etc., and behaviors like adding attachments and sending. "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Another common programming paradigm is **procedural programming** which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key  is that objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Since Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, you can choose the paradigm that best suits the problem at hand, mix different paradigms in one program, and/or switch from one paradigm to another."

    "## Classes in Python\n",
    "The primitive data structures available in Python, like numbers, strings, and lists are designed to represent simple things like the rating of movies, the name of movies, and favorite movies, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you wanted to represent something much more complicated?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s say we want to keep the records of employees in an organization. Definelty you should keep the details in organized manner so that you can access withut any confusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a list to track the empolyee details, the first element could be the employee’s name while the second element could represent his/her designation. How would we know that which element correspond to which detail to which employee? What if you had 100 different employees? Are you certain each employee has both a name and a designation, and so forth? What if you wanted to add other properties to these employees? This lacks organization, and it’s the exact need for classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. In the case of an employee, we could create an `Employee()` class to track properties about the Employee like the name and designation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that a class just provides a **structure**—it’s a **blueprint** for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. The `Employee()` class may specify that the name and designation are necessary for defining an employee, but it will not actually state what a specific employee’s name or designation is."
