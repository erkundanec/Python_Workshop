    "## Introduction\n",
    "Python is multi-paradigm programming language. Procedural programming and Structuring programming are vary common approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Procedural programming: which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, which flow sequentially in order to complete a task.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Structural programming: which structures a program so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    " \n",
    "Programmers choose the paradigm that best suits the problem at hand. They mix different paradigms in one program, and/or switch from one paradigm to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primitive data structures available in Python, like numbers, strings, and lists, are programmed in structural programming paradigm. However, these primitive data structures are designed to represent simple things like the rating of movies, the name of movies, and favorite movies, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you wanted to represent something much more complicated?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to keep the records of employees in an organization. Definitely you should keep the details in organized manner so that you can access without any confusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we use a list to track the employee details, the first element could be the employee's name while the second element could represent his/her designation. How would we know that which element corresponds to which detail and to which employee? What if you had 100 different employees? Are you certain each employee has both a name and a designation, and so forth? What if you wanted to add other properties to these employees like work experience? This lacks organization, and it is the exact need for classes."

    "## Classes in Python\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm which provides a means of **structuring programs** so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that objects are at the center of the object-oriented programming paradigm, not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure of the program as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. In the case of an employee, we could create an `Employee()` class to track properties about the Employee like the name and designation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that a class just provides a **structure** - it's a **blueprint** for how something should be defined, but it doesn't actually provide any real content itself. The `Employee()` class may specify that the name and designation are necessary for defining an employee, but it will not actually state what a specific employee's name or designation is."
